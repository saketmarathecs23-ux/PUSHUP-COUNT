# Enhanced Push-up Detector
An intelligent computer vision system that automatically detects and counts push-ups in video files using AI pose estimation. Built with MediaPipe and OpenCV, this tool provides real-time analysis with visual feedback and progress tracking.
## Features:
* Accurate Push-up Detection: Uses advanced pose estimation to detect proper push-up form
* Real-time Counter: Displays live count of completed push-ups
* Angle Analysis: Shows elbow angle measurements for form assessment
* Visual Progress Bars: Interactive progress indicators on both sides of the video
* Enhanced Overlays: Professional-looking UI with pose landmarks visualization
* Robust Error Handling: Validates input files and provides clear error messages
* Google Colab Ready: Optimized for easy use in Jupyter notebooks and Google Colab
